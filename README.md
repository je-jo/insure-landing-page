## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Mobile-first workflow
- Bootstrap 5
- Sass

### Observations

This was a great learning experience. I learned a lot about importing modules and modifying Bootstrap maps. Eventually, I settled for overriding default variables and writting custom styles, because it made more sense with the scope of this project.
